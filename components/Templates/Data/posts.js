But this has also brought along a heap of other issues that we have all turned a blind eye to. Right from inequality, increasing greenhouse gas emissions, to devastating consequences of climate change, and pandemics, we are seeing the effects of a resource-intensive model of development. This take-and-waste system is failing the people and the planet they inhabit.' },
            { type: 'paragraph', text: 'This is where the concept of the circular economy can actually help us. In contrast with the prevalent system, a circular economy focuses on reducing waste through reuse, repurposing, and recycling. Not just that, the circular economy model also ensures resource efficiency. But how exactly?' },
            { type: 'paragraph', text: 'In a circular economy, the process of production and consumption creates the least possible amount of waste. Aimining at sustainable development, a circular economy decreases overall consumption of resources by using them more efficiently. Plus, materials created are not disposed of; they are used again and again to continue to be of value.' },
            // { type: 'title', text: 'Main Content' },
            { type: 'paragraph', text: 'When it comes to the future of job creation, a circular economy can go a long way in increasing the number of jobs available in the world. According to World Bank estimates, climate change results in GDP losses of 7.5 per cent in East Asia, the Pacific and South Asia. Not just that, it also limits the right to work and “widens inequalities, particularly for women and vulnerable workers like migrants, people in poverty, and Indigenous and tribal peoples”. For instance, we all know how severe air pollution reduces productivity by decreasing working hours and deteriorating the health of workers. Moreover, if children in a family are affected by pollution, it usually falls upon the women to take care of them, thus exacerbating the gender divide at workplaces.' },
            { type: 'paragraph', text: 'But in a circular economy, these issues can be resolved equitably and sustainably. If one looks at jobs in waste management and recycling, they are often assigned to the poorest of people, and entail terrible working conditions as well. But when you introduce circularity in these processes, they bring about increased material efficiency by incorporating technology to optimize use of resources, rethink existing models, and enable everyone to create value through collaborations. A circular economy can generate jobs for a range of skill types as well, allowing a larger proportion of people with low and intermediate skills to be gainfully employed. The jobs become more dignified, more green, and much less harmful to the health of the people and the environment. A circular economy can help us redesign entire labour markets, thus offering us all the chance to narrow the gender divide to include women, youth, and other marginalised communities. ' },
            { type: 'paragraph', text: 'An extensive development of the circular economy is the need of the hour, and if executed as we have envisaged it, it has the potential to significantly reduce unemployment and aid the prosperity of everyone involved.' },

        title: 'A no-garbage world: On the importance of a circular economy for plastic',

        excerpt: 'What do we mean when we talk about creating a circular economy? A circular economy, by design, is supposed to be regenerative. All the components that are part of this economy flow alongside each other in a closed loop-like system, and are not meant to be used once and discarded.  Now, can you imagine what …',

All the components that are part of this economy flow alongside each other in a closed loop-like system, and are not meant to be used once and discarded. ' },
            { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Now, can you imagine what would happen if we could make plastic a part of this circular economy? Globally to date, there are approximately 8.3 billion tons of plastic in the world, and almost 6.3 billion of that is garbage. In the light of this data, wouldn’t it be great if we could collectively figure out ways to recover value from the plastic, without causing damage to the environment?' },
            { type: 'paragraph', text: 'According to a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, only 14% of the plastic packaging used globally is recycled, 40% ends up in landfills, and 32% in the rest of the ecosystem. We all know about the three Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle), but are yet to implement them in a way that benefits all stakeholders. Do a fundamental rethink about plastic reuse, and you will realise that it is possible to not only improve recycling and reuse, but also create a robust market for recycled and redesigned plastic products.' },
            { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Currently, poorly designed markets for recycled plastics act as the biggest deterrent to creating a circular economy for plastics. While many organisations are making recyclability their priority, only a handful are thinking about their role in creating demand for recycled plastic products. The other barrier to achieving plastics circularity is that manufacturers of plastic have no incentive to to consider end-of-life use throughout the development process. If they did, these manufacturers would then easily be able to customise plastic to meet specific requirements, and ensure they can be repurposed at the end of their initial use, and also simplify the recycling processes.' },
            { type: 'paragraph', text: 'One way to ensure plastic circularity is to resort to chemical recycling, using which the plastic can be stripped down to its original building block, and built up into brand new products such as pellets, soaps, bricks, and much more. Collaboration with different stakeholders, such as private corporations, recyclers, pyrolysis experts, government bodies, international development institutions, etc., can also help everyone innovate and find more uses cases for plastic waste, such as converting plastic to fuel. While we do this, it is also important to support initiatives that build economies of scale, deliver solutions at a local level while thinking global, and think of investing in recycling infrastructure in the long run. That way we can build a circular economy for plastic that benefits everyone – right from the bottom to the top. ' },
            { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Creating a circular economy for plastics offers a promising outlook for the world in terms of stemming the tidal wave of plastic waste. Once we ensure greater cooperation and coordination from all stakeholders in the value chain, it will become much easier to fulfill the vision of a no-garbage world.' },

        excerpt: 'An FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) report states that approximately 1.5 billion people are engaged in smallholder agriculture across the world.

            { type: 'paragraph', text: 'An FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) report states that approximately 1.5 billion people are engaged in smallholder agriculture across the world. And that number includes a whopping 75% of the world’s poorest people, most of who live in rural communities, and whose livelihood prospects are fully dependent on agriculture. Despite the fact that their role as food producers is so crucial in sustaining the world, they continue to remain unrepresented when it comes to reaping the commercial benefits of various agri-business prospects. ' },
            { type: 'paragraph', text: 'One alternative strategy for smallholder farmers and communities is to invest in educating their children so that they can diversify their pathways to prosperity through off-farm opportunities. However, this long-term farm strategy also requires present-day smallholders to achieve food security and earn consistently to pay for their children’s upbringing. ' },
            { type: 'paragraph', text: 'To overcome this barrier, we require an upgrade in processes, infrastructure, and farmer skills. Even then, the big question remains – what exactly will provide sustainable results in helping smallholder farmers improve their market realization? ' },
            { type: 'paragraph', text: 'We have seen how improved infrastructure and communications have helped generate opportunities for those farmers who have been able to link their production to sales. Take for instance the growth of Vietnamese smallholder coffee producers since the 1980s. Vietnam dominates the coffee industry as the second-largest producer in the world, only behind Brazil. Massive improvements in technology, promotion of gender equality, and implementing sustainable farming practices have helped the country create more than 3 million jobs from coffee-based agriculture. This is not only true for Vietnam, but many nations have reaped benefits from creating market opportunities for smallholder farmers. ' },
            { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Given this example, finding innovative solutions to link smallholder farmers to markets is possibly the most critical component of a long-term agri-business strategy. In India, we have mostly witnessed long marketing chains in agriculture owing to the presence of multiple intermediaries that add to the cost without really increasing value for smallholders. Similarly, when one looks at traditional procurement systems, they tend to limit the access of small farmers to alternative markets and channels. ' },
            { type: 'paragraph', text: 'That is why creating direct marketing opportunities through suitable linkages is one option that not only benefits producers, but also end consumers. This practice can help bring down costs, and also reduce the pitfalls associated with multiple handling of crop produce that leads to wastage. To attain this, the method of using an FPO (Farmer Producer Company) is the most effective way to link smallholders to the market. The advantage that FPOs offers is that they can tap high value markets and enter into partnerships with private organisations on terms that benefit everyone. This can give smallholders a better bargain, and create a much more transparent agri-market that rewards all stakeholders.' },
            { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Currently, there are more than 1000 such farmer producer companies in the country, and they have performed exceedingly well to help smallholders prosper. Constant support for an agri-business model like this can integrate many more smallholder farmers into the value chain, and ensure food and income security for them. And once we have established this support system, it will also open up the doors for farmers to access many more services such as technology and finance, that can help them operate to their full potential.' },
